**Questions**



*How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?*

- Following CRUD you can ensure that every part is functional and has a purpose of being there and every table interacts with the others. 

*How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?*

- I approach all problems with a computer science mind. This usally includes breaking down large components into smallers ones to understand them better. This allows for a logical type of thinking where I can come up with techiniques and strategies. These techinques and strategies I come up with are on average universal and allow me to solve multiple problems with one solution. 

*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?*

- Computer scientist are people who dedicate their life to the science of computers. This usally involves researching, designing, and developing new technology by studying computational theory.
